    <p>Have a Nice Life are a post-punk duo consisting of Connecticuit musicians Dan Barrett and Tim Macuga. The two met in the early 2000's in the New England punk scene, as both of them had bands of their own at the time who played together regularly. They became fast friends, bonding over common philosophical ideals and music interests.</p>

    <br> 

    <p>Having very little money, a laptop and some shoddy instruments, the two worked with what they had in order to get their musical vision out to the world. Over the course of 8 years, the two slowly assembled songs that would come together to form the now cult classic album <em>Deathconciousness</em>. In Janurary of 2008, it was released to little fanfare, but underground music forums and review websites gave it unanimous praise, and the band slowly began amassing a small, yet passionate following.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Fast-forward 11 years, and the band has become an underground sensation, their name synonomous with dark, emotionally heavy songs that listeners find when looking for catharsis. Due to Dan and Tim both holding full time careers, having families, and needing to recruit live members in order to play shows, Have a Nice Life has only played a dozen or so shows since the release of <em>Deathconciousness</em> in 2008, the most recent being a string of four shows in summer/early fall 2017. They make up for this, however, by providing an intense, uncompromising and crushingly powerful live show, guaranteed to leave even the most calloused underground music listener emotionally mooved by the end of their set.</p>

        <P>Their last preformance to date. Here, they're playing what is probably their most popular song, "Bloodhail". The passion and intensity of their fanbase is none more palpable than in this video; Dan's microphone cuts out at the beginning of the song, yet you hear the entire room singing along through the entire thing.<s></s></P>
